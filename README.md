In this project, we used tools and applications provided by AWS, like Glue, Athena, Kinesis, and 
S3, to analyze companiesâ€™ volatility. We used Lambda to collect data, Kinesis to deliver the data 
to our S3 bucket, and Athena to aggregate and query our data. I finally used Jupyter Notebook 
to represent the results I discovered visually. The zip file contains all resources, code, and 
screenshots needed to recreate this project.
